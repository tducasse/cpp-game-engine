# TWNG

## Work on it
- `git clone REPO`
- `cd twng`
- `git submodule update --init`
- open the folder with Visual Studio, it should detect CMake automatically
- right-click on CMakeLists.txt, then click "Debug" to run the project
- in order to test the lua part, put a file called `main.lua` in the same folder as the resulting `.exe` (`twng\out\build\x64-Debug` on my machine). An example is provided in "examples".
