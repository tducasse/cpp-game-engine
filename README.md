# TWNG

## Work on it
- `git clone REPO`
- `cd twng`
- `git submodule update --init`
- open the folder with Visual Studio, it should detect CMake automatically
- right-click on CMakeLists.txt, then click "Debug" to run the project
- the file in `lua/main.lua` is symlinked alongside the compiled executable, so modify this one and it should be fine
